## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app from the build folder to github pages. The homepage uri can be customized in the **package.json** file. There also exsits `npm run predeploy` which is simply an alias for `npm run build`

## Sections

  - ### `Email Types Section`
  	>The section contains all the types of email and the buttons for meeting. The section is divided into 3 major sections. The first is the section of email types such as Inbox , Starred etc. My plan is to to make those buttons such that they filter the type of images later on in the project. Next is the meeting tabs. Both buttons just lead to https://meet.google.com . Following is the hangout contacts with the functionality to either or remove a person from the contacts 

    #### Email types : **`Inbox`** **`Starred`** **`Snoozed`** **`Sent`** **`Drafts`**
	#### Meetings : **`New Meeting`** **`Join a Meeting`**
	#### Hangouts : **`List of Hangouts Contacts`** **`Add a Person`**

  - ### `Body` 
    > Incomplete
    
  - ### `Extra Apps section`
    > This section of the clone represents the four different apps in the menu on the right hand side of the page. It primarily has google calender , keep , tasks and google Contacts. It also has a add button. **Google Task** and **Add google apps** doesn't work.

	#### Apps : **`Google Calender`** **`Google Keeps`** **`Google Tasks`** **`Google Contacts`**
